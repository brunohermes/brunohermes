### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Who am i, my background.
My name is **Bruno Vinicius Hermes da Costa**, i'm a Bachelors Mechatronics Engineering Student, also a multidisciplinary student, 3D artist and Web Developer, whos always curious for new technologies that can improve human life. I started tinkering with hardware when i was only 6 fixing my first computer that my father gifted me (the best gift ever),  when i was 12 started programming my first websites; Then, at the age of 17, started learning web security, and could be considered a 100% self-taught web developer. With this background for which i'm proud of it, i decided that i wouldn't stop studying, and that is the main reason why i have so many courses and certificates, i'm seeking constant improvement on my carreer and who i am.

## Languages and Technologies i deal with.
